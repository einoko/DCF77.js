          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77">DCF77</a>
          time signal simulator written in JavaScript, using Web Audio API. You
          can use this web page to synchronize your DCF77-radio-controlled clock
          or watch. Click on <b>START TRANSMISSION</b>, set your radio
          controlled clock or watch to “receive” mode and place it near a
          speaker or a pair of headphones. It should take a few minutes at most
          for your watch to synchronize. If you cannot get it to work, try
          increasing the volume.

          The transmitted signal is automatically in
          <span class="correctTimezone"></span> timezone (DCF77 signal time).
          Some filtering has been applied to the signal to make it less harsh on
          ears and to improve the signal quality. Nevertheless, the signal is a
          <span class="warning">high-pitched 15.5kHz sine wave</span>, so please
          protect your hearing and do not start the transmission with full
          volume! The signal has been successfully tested on a Casio Wave Ceptor
          watch and a radio controlled wall clock. The best results were had
          with an iPhone speaker, or a pair of headphones (most headphone brands
          should work), with volume set to about 80–100%.
